This is used for emergency personnel. There are two roles: Call taker (they are the ones that answere the phone), and Dispatcher (they coordinate emergency vehicles and personnel). There are three areas: North (NECC), Central (CECC), South (SECC). Sometimes people call in sick and that creates a gap. These gaps are listed under each role and people can apply for the overtime. In the admin tab, there are sections to administer the overtime requests. In order to become an admin for testing, just change user.role to 0 in the database.
