# Overtime tracker

This is used for emergency personnel to track overtime.
Sometimes people call in sick and that creates a gap (timeslot). These gaps are listed under each role and people can 
apply for the overtime. 

There are two roles: Call taker (they are the ones that answer the phone), and Dispatcher (they coordinate emergency
vehicles and personnel). Provision has been made for adding more.
There are three areas: North (NECC), Central (CECC), South (SECC).

In the admin tab, there are sections to administer the overtime requests. In order to become an admin for testing,
just change user.role to 0 in the database.
